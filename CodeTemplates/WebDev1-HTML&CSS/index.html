    <p>In hip hop, so much can be explained by the rise and fall of record labels.</p>

    <p>Lil Wayne's ascent is the story of <b>Cash Money.</b> The Dirty South starts with <b>LaFace Records.</b> The east-coast/west-coast feud is <b>Bad Boy vs Death Row.</b> In hip hop, the artist-label relationship isn't just a business deal, but a commitment to an identity.</p>

    <p>We wanted to surface the notable lables in hip hop's history, so we measured every label by its artists' chart performance on Billboard (collaborating with <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinbeacham"> Kevin Beacham</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhymesayers_Entertainment">Rhymesayers</a> to call out insights). By highlighting the labels who produced the most hits at any given time, we'd understand who was wielding enormous influence on hip hop's sound, distribution, and direction.</p>
