    <h4 style="font-family: 'merriweather';">This is a story about proving, with data, that <i>No Diggity</i> by Blackstreet is timeless.</h4>
    <p>Until recently, it was impossible to measure the popularity of older music. Billboard charts and album sales only tell us about a song's popularity at the time of its release.</p>
    <p>But now we have Spotify, a buffet of all of music, new and old. Tracks with fewer plays are fading into obscurity. And those with more plays are remaining in the cultural ether.</p>
    <p>20 years have passed since <i>No Diggity's'</i> release. Its popularity on Spotify, relative to every other song from the 90s, is a strong signal for whether it will be remembered by our children's children. So let's examine every song that ever charted, 1990 - 1999, and rank them by number of plays on Spotify, today.</p>
